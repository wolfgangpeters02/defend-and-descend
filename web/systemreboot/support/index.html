        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is System: Reboot?</h3>
          <p>System: Reboot is a tower defense game set inside a computer. You defend your motherboard against viruses by placing firewalls, fighting bosses, upgrading system components, and unlocking new sectors. Think of it as a real-time strategy game where your CPU is the last line of defense.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need an account to play?</h3>
          <p>No. The game requires no account, no sign-up, and no personal information. Just download and play. Your progress is saved locally on your device.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is the game free?</h3>
          <p>Yes. System: Reboot is completely free with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no subscriptions. All content is unlockable through gameplay.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What data does the game collect?</h3>
          <p>Only anonymous gameplay analytics (via Mixpanel) to help us improve game balance and features. No personal data is collected. See our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do firewalls (towers) work?</h3>
          <p>Firewalls are your primary defense. Place them on your motherboard to automatically target and destroy incoming viruses. Each firewall costs Hash (the in-game currency) and PSU power to deploy. You can sell firewalls to recoup some of their cost and free up power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do boss fights work?</h3>
          <p>Bosses appear periodically and are immune to firewall damage. You fight them directly using protocols (weapons). Defeat bosses to earn Hash rewards and blueprints that unlock new protocols. Each boss has different attack patterns and difficulties.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are protocols?</h3>
          <p>Protocols are your weapons for boss fights. You start with a basic protocol and unlock more by collecting blueprints from boss kills. Protocols can be compiled (crafted) and upgraded using Hash. Each protocol has unique stats like damage, range, and fire rate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What happens when viruses reach my CPU?</h3>
          <p>Unlike traditional tower defense games, leaks don't instantly end the game. Instead, they reduce your system efficiency, which lowers your Hash income. Keep your defenses strong to maintain high efficiency and maximize your earnings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are sectors?</h3>
          <p>Your motherboard is divided into sectors. Each sector has its own lanes where viruses attack. You start with one sector and can unlock more as you progress. More sectors mean more lanes to defend but also more Hash income potential.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does the game earn Hash while I'm away?</h3>
          <p>Yes. When you leave the game, your defenses continue running in the background (simulated). When you return, you'll receive offline earnings based on your setup's performance. Stronger defenses and higher efficiency mean more offline Hash.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I upgrade my system components?</h3>
          <p>Visit the Motherboard tab to upgrade components like CPU (processing power), PSU (tower capacity), RAM (game speed), HDD (storage), and Network (Hash multiplier). Each upgrade costs Hash and improves your overall capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>I lost my game progress. Can you restore it?</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, game progress is stored locally on your device and we have no access to it. If you deleted the app or changed devices, progress cannot be recovered unless you had an iCloud backup that included app data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
