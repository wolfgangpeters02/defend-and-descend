bosses on board: 
f- overclock button is not localized, needs to go into l10n
f- switching tabs resets the board, it should either continue or pause - depending on what's best for performance
f- I think the game (board movement) is not paused during the boss fight, but it should 
f- does overclocking double the hash generation? 

UI
f- BOARD: the top menu with energy, hash and efficiency doesn't look well aligned and there are linebreaks between "100" (efficiency) and the "%" sign 
f- BOARD: the tower bar at the bottom has room for 5 towers, we need a concept for more towers -- make recommendations 
f- BOARD: the CPU core in the middle of the board has an icon on top of the written "CPU" and this written "CPU" is on top of something else. And below it reads "# 0" as if it wouldn't generate any hash. 
f- the bottom menu still has the BOSS tab, but we don't need that anymore or it can move into a "sub menu" because the boss fights are triggered via the BOARD now. That means we only have BOARD and Arsenal as menu. It's not really worth the space that this takes up. We could remove it, that way increase the board view and move Arsenal somewhere else reachable via an icon? Just an idea... And rework the arsenal to also be the home for anything else setup wise (now and in the future). 




general notes:
f- review all popups: some have "Done", some have an "x" at the top, others have nothing; 
what I think makes sense: clicking on the side so the popup closes, a littel "---" at the top middle indicating it can be moved down so it closes and/or an "x" in the top right
f- most text (headline) is written with "_" underscores instead of spaces, recommend wether to keep that or change to spaces. The issue is weird linebreaks. 



f- 0% efficiency triggers "survive" arena (system freeze), there are red lines spawing and moving towards the border - these red lines need one gap so that  the player can excape

arsenal:
f- the locked items should indidcate that the blueprint to encode these has not been found. Right now it just says it needs hash to unlock them, but that doesn't work without the blueprint
- 


f- The game title is "System: Reboot". We went through different names throughout development. Can we do a complete rebrand of docs, references, code, folder name, project name, I don't know what else so that we don't have legendarysurvivors, or any other title reference.

The game needs a cool loading screen, or does it? Since we are a no-graphics game and everything is code, this should also be in line with that - if we add a loading screen at all. 



BALANCING

"The starter sector (Power Supply) is free, Kernel Pulse is given as a starter protocol (0 compile cost), and the threat level starts low." 
--> the starter district is unlocked, should we lock it (no costs, no requirement) so the user must unlock it as the first thing in the game? That would teach the player how unlocking of new areas work. Needs a big indicator on the Board for the player to tap on. 

"Concern: With 10 Ħ/sec base rate and tower placement costing 50 Ħ for common... players can place ~1 tower every 5 seconds. Is that enough time to "explore"? They may feel rushed to place towers before viruses arrive."
--> I believe this let's the player place all towers within the first few seconds, that's too fast, right? 

"Implementation Status: The difficulty scaling exists: Easy: Boss has 1.0x HP, 0.5x damage; Player has 2.0x HP, 2.0x damage" 
--> It's pretty much impossible to defeat the boss, even on easy, with the first level 1 tower/weapon.

"Suggestion: Consider requiring a boss-drop protocol (like Burst Protocol from Cyberboss) for RAM sector, creating a clearer "boss → blueprint → district" loop." 
--> 100%: the first boss defeat should drop the blueprint for the NEXT district (RAM), not the current (that's pointless as it's already unlocked). 

"If you want this to feel gated: Increase RAM cost to 10,000-15,000 Ħ, forcing at least one overnight session before unlock."
--> Yes, RAM (and all following districts) must cost much more, right? 

"Clarity needed: Is the HDD system surfaced in the UI clearly? Do players know they have a storage limit and can upgrade it?"
--> no, it's not clear it's capped, it's not clear how (HDD system), it's not clear how to upgrade.

"Suggestion: The welcome back modal should show defense/offense comparison: "Your towers dealt 1,200 DPS. Viruses had 1,800 HP/sec. 3 viruses leaked.""
--> that's a good suggestion + a question: how can we introduce threat better and make the user understand that threat increases (even when offline), that: higher threat --> stronger enemies but same defense --> enemies reach the CPU --> efficiency drops --> efficiency drops to zero without checking your defense --> player needs to come back regularly (4-24 hours or so) to upgrade towers and "reset threat". 
And this yields 2 new questions: 1. the leveling up from towers is not balanced, I can quickly upgrade them to level 10 in the first 1-2 sessions and should the dps increase be exponential instead of linear? Secondly, how does threat reset? Does it? 

"Easy should give 600+ Ħ (1 minute equivalent at minimum)
Nightmare should give 10,000+ Ħ to feel like a major income source"
--> we probably decrease the idle hash production already but this probably still makes sense to make a bossfight rewarding. 

"Suggestion: Show projected efficiency in the HUD: "Current efficiency: 95%. Estimated in 8h: 75%""
--> good idea, but also we need to consider explaining threat level somehow.

"To create earlier energy pressure: Reduce starting PSU to 300W or increase tower power costs."
--> It didn't feel that way in a few sessions but let's not touch this for now until the other points are in better shape. 







Here's what the game is supposed to feel like, from a players perspective: 
- I open the game and load it, I understand the 3 cards tutorial, I know what to do
- I start placing towers on the board in the first district and have time to explore the board a bit
- I have success with my level 1 towers to defeat the incoming viruses
- I play longer and a critical virus appears, I fight it with my level 1 weapon, the only weapon I have and defeat it relatively easily on "easy" (unbalanced here). I fail miserably on hard or nightmare difficulty. 
- As a reward I unlock a new tower and the blueprint for the next district. 
- I don't have enough hash to unlock the new district; by far not enough hash
- I understand how to get more hash (unclear here if hash is capped)
- I close the game.
- I reopen the game, a message welcomes me back with the progress my defense and CPU hash production did. I understand what happened and why (unclear here). 
- Based on the learnings how offline progression works, I work on my defense, I level up towers with the hash earned, I still don't have nearly enough hash to unlock the next district (unbalanced here). 
- I decide to overclock to speed up hash production and play bosses for extra hash. I defeat bosses on easy for some hash, I try different weapons (I have 2 - 3 so far depending on my drop luck for blueprints from the easy bossfights), I might defeat the boss on "normal". I realize this gives a great hash boost (unbalanced here). 
- I close the game with a better understanding when I should come back to not have efficiency dropped to zero for hours (or days). 
- I come back, collect my hash, can unlock district 2, I spend some time realizing that I have a tower placement problem, an energy problem, upgrade my PSU to place more towers, lose efficiency because I might have unlocked the new district too soon without having the right defense mechanics in place, etc. I tinker around with towers, spend hash on upgrades for my towers which signifiicantly increases my defense, etc. 
--- this is how far we should optimize the game. Once that's locked in, we continue. What do you think? And how do you evaluate each point made here against the implementation?




Upgrading components: 
I want each district (PSU, RAM, ...) to be upgradable just like the towers. 
Once the blueprint is found they can be unlocked via the BOARD or via the Arsenal (they need their own section after Towers). From there on they can be upgraded as well (not global upgrade, component-individual upgraded). 
Example: I have a starter PSU that gives me 300 watts. Upgrading it to level 2 (with hash) makes it a 400 watts PSU. 
Like this I need you to suggest effects for all components. 






TASK: Audit and centralize all hardcoded balance values in BalanceConfig.swift

SEARCH PATTERNS TO FIND VIOLATIONS:

1. Hardcoded numeric literals in game logic:
   grep -rn "CGFloat(" SystemReboot/GameEngine/ --include="*.swift" | grep -E "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"
   grep -rn "TimeInterval" SystemReboot/ --include="*.swift" | grep -E "= [0-9]"
   grep -rn "let.*= [0-9]" SystemReboot/GameEngine/ --include="*.swift"

2. Duplicated formulas (especially pow, scaling calculations):
   grep -rn "pow(2.0" SystemReboot/ --include="*.swift"
   grep -rn "pow(" SystemReboot/ --include="*.swift" | grep -v BalanceConfig
   grep -rn "\* CGFloat(level" SystemReboot/ --include="*.swift"
   grep -rn "level - 1" SystemReboot/ --include="*.swift"

3. Magic numbers in conditionals:
   grep -rn "< 10" SystemReboot/ --include="*.swift" | grep -v BalanceConfig
   grep -rn "> 100" SystemReboot/ --include="*.swift"
   grep -rn "== [0-9]" SystemReboot/GameEngine/ --include="*.swift"

FOR EACH VIOLATION FOUND:

1. Determine if it's a balance value (affects gameplay/feel) or implementation detail
2. If balance value:
   a. Check if BalanceConfig already has an appropriate section
   b. Add the value with a descriptive name and comment
   c. Replace hardcoded value with BalanceConfig.Section.valueName
3. If it's a formula used in multiple places:
   a. Create a static function in BalanceConfig
   b. Replace all instances with calls to that function

VALIDATION:
- Build project: xcodebuild -scheme SystemReboot build
- Run balance simulator: swift tools/BalanceSimulator/main.swift all
- Verify no regressions in gameplay

EXISTING CENTRALIZED FORMULAS (use these, don't recreate):
- BalanceConfig.exponentialUpgradeCost(baseCost:currentLevel:)
- BalanceConfig.levelStatMultiplier(level:)
- BalanceConfig.Components.upgradeCost(for:at:)
- BalanceConfig.HashEconomy.hashPerSecond(at:)

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Formulas duplicated across files (highest risk of drift)
2. Damage/health/speed values in GameEngine/Systems/
3. Timing values (cooldowns, intervals, durations)
4. Threshold values (level caps, spawn limits)




Current issues:
- welcome back screen is not showing
- bosses only spawn in sector 1 (PSU) (what are sectors or districts or areas on the BOARD called?)
- I want to tap on the sector where the viruses spawn from like I can tap on them when they are still locked - I want to see the info what this is and what the beneifts are from this sector
- having unlocked sector 2 (RAM) doesn't increase the hash cap (visibly at least in the top HUD)
- I can go above the hash cap when defeating bosses, can't I? At least the HUD displays that (currently on my phone: 66k/25k)
- The sector unlocks/spawn "areas" should be double in size so the player knows they are important and they draw attention to them
- I want the sectors all listed in the System menu: first the equipped weapon, then towers (compiled protocolls, then locked), then areas (unlocked, locked), then bossfights 
- tapping on towers in the Systems menu opens a popup menu, this has a "Done" button instead of the x we have on the other popups. And the --- is missing at the top indicating the popup can be removed by sliding it down. 
- the tutorial says swipe or tap to move to the next card, but tapping doesn't work, only swiping. 
- the top HUD often linebreaks - should we plan a 2-line menu from the start to control the linebreaking better to ensure this always looks good? 
- tapping on Energy in the HUD let's me upgrade the PSU (good!), this is the menu that should appear as well when tapping on the PSU on the Board. And Similar with the hash -> currently it's just info but the upgrade button is missing here. 
- tapping on Efficiency in the HUD should also open a menu to explain efficiency.  


Current issues: 
- tapping on the components in the sectors gives a popup with info and upgrade button: they don't all look the same; Memory Banks and Graphics core are a "card in the middle" and don't have an upgrade button, PSU is a card from the bottom. All components should have this appearing card from the bottom as the default. 
- this goes for all popups: they should all have the same look & feel: coming up from the bottom, with the "---" in the middle top indicating that they can be swiped down again and a subtle "x" in the top right corder to close them. And they all should close when the user taps outside of the card. 
- while we are at it, make tapping on the CPU in the middle show the efficiency popup that already exists. 
- when done with the above, create a document explaining all the towers (+their weapon counterpart) in detail so we can start discussing those
