        <h2>What is System: Reboot?</h2>
        <p>System: Reboot is a tower defense game set inside a computer. Viruses are attacking your motherboard, and your job is to stop them before they reach the CPU. Place firewalls to defend lanes, upgrade your system components, and fight bosses that are immune to tower damage.</p>
        <p>The game blends classic tower defense with idle mechanics and boss encounters. When you're actively playing, you manage tower placement, fight bosses, and optimize your defenses. When you're away, the game simulates your setup and rewards you with offline earnings when you return.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="info-section">
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Your motherboard is divided into sectors, each with lanes where viruses spawn. You place firewalls along these lanes to intercept and destroy threats. Each firewall costs Hash (the in-game currency) and uses power from your PSU.</p>
        <p>Periodically, bosses appear. These are powerful threats immune to firewall damage &ndash; you fight them directly using protocols (weapons). Defeating bosses earns Hash rewards and can drop blueprints that unlock new protocols with unique abilities.</p>
        <p>Between sessions, you upgrade system components: a faster CPU multiplies your income, more PSU power lets you deploy more towers, additional RAM speeds up gameplay, and Network upgrades multiply your Hash earnings.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="info-section">
        <h2>The Efficiency System</h2>
        <p>Unlike traditional tower defense games where leaks mean game over, System: Reboot uses an efficiency system. When viruses leak through your defenses, your system efficiency drops, reducing your Hash income. This means weaker defenses don't end your game &ndash; they slow your progress.</p>
        <p>Keep your firewalls strong and well-placed to maintain high efficiency. The better your defense, the more you earn &ndash; both while playing and while away.</p>
