        <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: February 2026 | Last Updated: February 2026</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>System: Reboot ("the App") is a tower defense game for iOS developed by Wolfgang Peters ("Developer", "we", "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and how it is stored.</p>
        <p>The App does not require an account or registration. It collects anonymous gameplay analytics via Mixpanel and stores game progress locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Analytics (Mixpanel)</h3>
        <p>We use <strong>Mixpanel</strong>, a third-party analytics service, to collect anonymous gameplay data. The purpose is to understand player behavior and improve game balance.</p>

        <p><strong>Identifier:</strong> The App uses Apple's <code>identifierForVendor</code> (IDFV) as a distinct ID for analytics. This is a device-scoped UUID that resets if the App is deleted and reinstalled. It is not an advertising identifier.</p>

        <p><strong>Events collected:</strong></p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Event</th>
              <th>Properties</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>App launched</td><td>First launch flag</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Session start</td><td>&ndash;</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Tutorial completed</td><td>Tutorial type</td></tr>
            <tr><td>First tower placed</td><td>&ndash;</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Boss fight started</td><td>Boss ID, difficulty</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Boss fight completed</td><td>Boss ID, difficulty, victory, first kill</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Blueprint dropped</td><td>Boss ID, protocol ID</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Protocol compiled</td><td>Protocol ID, cost</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Protocol upgraded</td><td>Protocol ID, from/to level</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Component upgraded</td><td>Component name, from/to level</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Sector unlocked</td><td>Sector ID, cost</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Level up</td><td>New level</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Wave completed</td><td>Wave number</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Offline earnings claimed</td><td>Hash amount, hours away</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Mixpanel's automatic event tracking is disabled. Only the events listed above are sent. IP-based geolocation is disabled in our Mixpanel configuration.</p>

        <p>Analytics data is sent to Mixpanel's EU endpoint (<code>api-eu.mixpanel.com</code>) over HTTPS. Mixpanel processes and stores this data according to their own privacy policy: <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Local Data</h3>
        <p>Game progress (player profile, upgrades, tower placements, settings, and preferences) is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults. This data is not transmitted to any server by the App. Some gameplay milestones that are stored locally are also reported as analytics events (see table above).</p>

        <p>Your device's operating system may back up app data as part of iCloud or device backups. These backups are controlled by your device settings.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Analytics data</strong> is used to understand player progression, balance game difficulty, and improve the App.</li>
          <li><strong>Local data</strong> is used to save and restore your game progress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The only third-party service used by the App is <strong>Mixpanel</strong> for analytics, as described in Section 1.1. No other third-party SDKs are included in the App.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Analytics data is transmitted over HTTPS. Local data is stored within the App's iOS sandbox and is protected by the device's security features.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Opt out of analytics:</strong> You can disable analytics at any time in the App under Settings &gt; Privacy. When disabled, no further events are sent and your local analytics identity is reset.</li>
          <li><strong>Delete analytics data:</strong> You can tap "Delete Analytics Data" in Settings &gt; Privacy to reset your analytics identity, unlinking future events from past data.</li>
          <li><strong>Delete local game data:</strong> You can erase all local game data by using the "Reset Account" option in Settings, or by uninstalling the App.</li>
          <li><strong>Server-side deletion:</strong> To request deletion of analytics data already transmitted to Mixpanel, contact us at the address below. We will process your request in accordance with applicable data protection law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App does not require registration, does not have social features, and does not contain advertising or in-app purchases.</p>

        <h2>7. International Users (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>Analytics data is processed via Mixpanel's EU servers. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest in improving the App. The App does not collect personal data as defined by the GDPR. You may exercise your rights under applicable data protection law by contacting us.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Local data is retained until you delete the App or reset your data. Analytics data is retained by Mixpanel according to their retention policies.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
